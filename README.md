# About Me <a name="aboutme"></a>

My name is Vitor Garcia and I'm a Chemical Engineer and Software Developer.

I have bachelor's and master's degrees in chemical engineering both concluded in 2014 and 2019 in the institute [Centro Universitário FEI][fei-url].

Despite worked as chemical engineer for eight years, I love everything that involves computing, technology and programming. 

In 2017, after having my first contact with MATLAB programming through my chemical engineer master's degree, I started to learn commercial and object-oriented language like Java, C# and Python.

In March of 2017, I become a Java software developer in a small company named [Frotelle Alimentos][frotelle-url] and worked until January 2021, after I decided to move from Brazil to my mother origin continent...Europe.

Now, I am working to become a software engineer. Parallel to this, I am studying topics on computer science (computer architecture, software and networks, digital systems and embedded systems and software engineering) and help the community with simple tutorials teaching basic concepts in computer science that I learned by myself through books, courses and documentation.

# Projects <a name="projects"></a>

## Tutorial Projects <a name="tutorials"></a>

Despite being a chemical engineer and having studied some subjects related to computer science (Algorithms, Calculus, Physics, Linear Algebra, Analytical Geometry, Electrical, Probability and Statistics), I had no contact with other important subjects such as Digital Systems, Structure Data, Computer Architecture, Computer Network, Database, Operating Systems and Software Engineering in my chemical engineer degree.

I believe in an open-source world that we can study, learning and teach with the internet power and help from the developer’s community and we just need the desire to learn and be curiosity.

This Projects have the aim to create simple tutorials and basics about logic programming, data structure, oriented object, hardware, software, computer network, project design, basic of some programming languages and much more!
