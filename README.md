# About Me <a name="aboutme"></a>

My name is Vitor Garcia and I'm a software developer since 2017 after having my first contact with MATLAB programming in my chemical engineer master's degree.

I have bachelor's and master's degrees in chemical engineering both concluded in 2014 and 2019 [Centro Universitario da FEI][fei-url], but I love everything that involves computing, technology and programm.

# About Me <a name="aboutme"></a>

More than eight years of experience in food and manufacturing industry as a chemical engineer and more than three years of experience as software developer.

I already worked as a software developer in a small company named [Frotelle Alimentos][frotelle-url] 

Despite being a chemical engineer and having studied some subjects related to computer science (Algorithms, Calculus, Physics, Linear Algebra, Analytical Geometry, Electrical, Probability and Statistics), I had no contact with other important subjects such as Digital Systems, Structure Data, Computer Architecture, Computer Network, Database, Operating Systems and Software Engineering in my chemical engineer degree.

I believe in an open-source world that we can study, learning and teach with the internet power and help from the developers community and we just need the desire to learn and be curiosity.
